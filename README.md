Simple REST API + Client using Express and Backbone.js

![wow!](docs/example.png)

## Limitations
- JSON file based User database (DB is not a area of interest)
- Updating a model is not supported on the frontend, only the API.
- The backend does not manage user id (pk). The index page simply generates a random id for each new user.
